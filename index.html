						 <blockquote><p><strong>We all need a space to feel heard. <br />Sometimes, that becomes difficult in our daily lives.</strong> </p> </blockquote> 
						<h2 id="one">Psychotherapy</h2>
						<p>I offer a compassionate, direct approach to individual therapy. My role is to support you in reaching toward your best self, the one you may have lost touch with. I want to hear about the problems you see, as well as what is going well in your life. I am an active-listener, supportive and non-judgmental. I will provide an alternate perspective and we will discover the patterns getting in your way.</p>
						
						<p>Individual therapy is highly personalized and tailored to meet your specific needs. I provide short term services for immediate concerns and longer term therapy for chronic issues. You can expect individual therapy sessions to be about 50 minutes. Typically, we will meet once a week or every other week. This will depend on your scheduling needs and what brings you in. During our first session, I will ask a variety of questions intended to focus not only on the primary concerns that bring you in, but also about how your past affects who you are today. Please remember that our sessions are confidential and any information we exchange is considered protected health information.</p>

						<h2>Bio</h2>
						<p>I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology with a concentration in Women's Studies in 2007. I completed my Masterâ€™s Degree in Social Work in 2009, both from the University of Wisconsin.  Much of my professional work has focused on supporting clients in their exploration of the connection between trauma and addiction. I have extensive training and knowledge working with anxiety, depression, PTSD, relationship difficulties and substance use concerns. I also have experience working with clients who identify in the LGBTQ community. I feel strongly about utilizing evidence-based practices and specifically incorporating mindfulness meditation into my work. I am trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), a specialized treatment that is particularly effectively for trauma survivors. My primary practice is at a community health center in Chicago, where I coordinate the intimate partner violence program and offer individual and group psychotherapy.</p>
