						<h2>Bio</h2>
						<p>I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Social Work  with a concentration in mental health, both from the University of Wisconsin. Over the last ten years of clinical practice, much of my work has focused on supporting clients in their exploration of trauma. I have extensive training and knowledge working with anxiety, depression, PTSD, relationship difficulties and substance use concerns, as well as specifically with clients who identify in LGBTQ communities. I feel strongly about utilizing evidence-based practices and regularly incorporate mindfulness meditation into my work. I am trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), a specialized treatment that is particularly effectively for trauma survivors. I am highly relational in my approach to therapy and supervision. My primary practice is at a community health center in Chicago, where I have worked in a variety of clinical and administrative roles.</p>

						<h2>Clinical Supervision & Consultation</h2>
						<p>Over the past several years, I have cultivated a passion for supporting new clinicians and building strong clinical teams. I have had the opportunity to supervise graduate students and licensed social workers working toward their LCSW. Additionally, I have provided individual supervision to more senior clinicians- licensed clinical social workers, licensed clinical professional counselors and licensed clinical psychologists. I see clinical supervision as a collaborative, relational process. Discussions of challenging clinical interactions are paired with an intentional focus on the impact of the clinical work on the clinician.</p>

						<h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
						<p>I offer a compassionate, direct approach to individual therapy. My role is to support you in reaching toward your best self, the one you may have lost touch with. I want to hear about the problems you see, as well as what is going well in your life. I am an active-listener, supportive and non-judgmental. I will provide an alternate perspective and we will discover the patterns getting in your way.</p>
						
						<p>Individual therapy is highly personalized and tailored to meet your specific needs. I provide short term services for immediate concerns and longer term therapy for chronic issues. You can expect individual therapy sessions to be about 50 minutes. Typically, we will meet once a week or every other week. This will depend on your scheduling needs and what brings you in. During our first session, I will ask a variety of questions intended to focus not only on the primary concerns that bring you in, but also about how your past impacts who you are today. Please remember that our sessions are confidential and any information we exchange is considered protected health information.</p>
