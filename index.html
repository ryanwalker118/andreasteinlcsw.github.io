						<h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
						<p>Andrea offers a compassionate, direct approach to individual therapy. Her role is to support clients in reaching toward their best self, the one they may have lost touch with. She is an active listener, supportive and non-judgmental. She will provide an alternate perspective and help you discover the patterns getting in your way. </p>

						<p>Andrea feels strongly about utilizing evidence-based practices and regularly incorporates cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation into her work. She is trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), a specialized treatment that is particularly effective for trauma survivors. Andrea’s therapy practice is grounded in feminist and relational theories. Her focus on social justice and trauma-informed care are critical components of her therapy work. </p>
						
						<p>Andrea has extensive training and knowledge working with anxiety, depression, PTSD, relationship difficulties and substance use concerns. She has a deep commitment to working with individuals identifying within LGBTQ+ communities. Andrea has a dedication and a familiarity in affirmatively practicing with individuals identifying as kinky, poly and folks describing their relationship structures as open or non-monogamous. She regularly serves as a support for folks exploring sexuality and gender identity.</p>
						
						<p>Individual therapy is highly personalized and tailored to meet each client's specific needs. Andrea provides short term services for immediate concerns and longer-term therapy for chronic issues.
